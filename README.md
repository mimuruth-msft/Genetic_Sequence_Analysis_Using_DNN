Instructions to compile code on Google Colab: 
0. Dataset is being read from Github. So, downloading datasets is not required.
1. First, login to your Gmail account.
2. Go to this public Google Colab link: INSERT here
3. Click 'Connect' on the top right-hand corner.
4. Once Google Colab says it's Connected, go to the Runtime tab at the top left-hand side, then click 'Run All.
'
5. It will give you a Warning Module, but click 'Run Anyway' to continue.
6. After ~2.5 to 3 minutes, my code will compile.
Thank you.
